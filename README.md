# About me

My name is Aleks Farmah and I am currently an A level computer science student studying at BHASVIC.
I am very interested in working in the digital sector when I am older, particularily cybersecurity. 
I am currently working on my OCR a level computer science NEA, which will be a video game made with unity!
I am also currently working on achieving digital certifications - right now I am learning Microsoft az900, and once I have done that I will be attempting CompTIA Security+.
I achieved a grade 8 (A*) in GCSE computer science, and an A in my most recent A level mock exam! I have also recieved a few certifications, such as Fujitsu's cybersecurity, and Kainos virtual work experience.
I believe I have very strong teamwork and communication skills, developed through working with peers in a variety of ways. I am a good listener, and always enthusiastic to learn something new!

## My work

### Kashyk Hotel

Collaborators: Leon Botfield, Sam Augnier.

A console-based hotel management system simulating real-world operations:
Guest Check-in/out with age verification, dynamic booking IDs, and room allocation.
Dinner Table Reservations (Star Wars-themed tables: Endor, Naboo).
Billing System with discounts for seniors (10%) and children (50% on board rates).

Key Features:

<ul> Data Structures: Used multi-dimensional arrays (table[2][3]) to manage dinner slots and parallel arrays (rooms[], userAgeList[], etc.) for guest data. </ul>
<ul> Input Validation: Robust checks for date formats, guest limits (max 4), and room availability. </ul>
<ul> Dynamic Pricing: Room rates vary by type (e.g., Room 1: $100/day, Room 6: $50/day). </ul>
<ul> Booking Logic: Randomized booking IDs (e.g., LastName + rand()), table conflict resolution. </ul>

Challenges and Learning:
<ul> Memory Management: Handled string inputs safely with fflush(stdin).</ul>
<ul> Edge Cases: Solved overbooking issues for rooms/tables and age-based discounts.</ul>
<ul> Team Work: Split tasks (e.g. one peer focused on billing, another on table logic) and merged via Git.</ul>
<ul> User Flow: Iterated menu design for clarity (printf prompts, switch-case navigation).</ul>
